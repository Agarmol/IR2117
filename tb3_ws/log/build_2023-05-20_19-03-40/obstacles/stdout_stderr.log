CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/adri/Documentos/GitHub/IR2117/tb3_ws/build/obstacles/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/usuario/Documentos/GitHub/IR2117/tb3_ws/build/obstacles where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/adri/Documentos/GitHub/IR2117/tb3_ws/src/obstacles/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/usuario/Documentos/GitHub/IR2117/tb3_ws/src/obstacles/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
